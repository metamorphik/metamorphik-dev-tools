# 🧰 Metamorphik Dev Tools

> **Stance** — Small, focused utilities. Clear boundaries. Predictable behavior. Minimal APIs. No surprise deps. Ship with tests; document just enough; iterate in public.

---

## 📦 What’s here (today)

* **react-scoped-events** — scoped, hierarchical event system for React.

  * Folder: [https://github.com/metamorphik/metamorphik-dev-tools/tree/main/packages/react-scoped-events](https://github.com/metamorphik/metamorphik-dev-tools/tree/main/packages/react-scoped-events)
  * Readme & usage live **in the package**.

*(New packages land here only when they meet the same bar.)*

---

## 🧭 How we work

* 🔹 **Quality over breadth** — keep APIs tiny and intentional.
* 🔹 **Determinism first** — explicit scopes/state over global magic.
* 🔹 **No root build** — work happens inside each package.
* 🔹 **CI** — runs per package; root stays lightweight.

---

## 🚀 Releases

* Per‑package, **tag‑driven**.

  * Events: `events-vX.Y.Z`
